Surge was initially formed as a digital studio to help startups and scaleups clients grow their business through a range of services including design, development and business strategy. We were fortunate enough to work with some amazing clients and interesting projects.

Since then the client-serving portion of the business was scaled down and focus shifted to internal experimentation and application development.
