I'm still working at Corellium, and currently focusing on rolling out new features to our core app. While I've only been there for one year, my time has been packed full of shipping new projects and rolling out new features.

## Design System

I was one of the first dedicated Frontend Engineering hires brought on board to help the company as it moves to scale up its growth. Our team had a large number of future projects planned, so we quickly identified the need for a comprehensive design system.

Our goals were to create a system to allow us to quickly build new interfaces, introduce a consistent visual style and improve developer experience. We called it <em>Magic</em> ðŸ§™.

It was built out as a Storybook-based design system on React, Next.js, Typescript, CSS Modules (w/ PostCSS), Tailwind, and deployed for preview on Vercel. This stack formed the base for all future frontend projects.

## Corellium.com

Once our design system was ready we moved onto rebuilding the marketing website as our first build test. The majority of the website content is loaded from Prismic.

## Trial Request Flow

Next up was the trial request flow which website visitors can fill out to get their hands on Corellium. This has had many iterations and features including Stripe billing integration with 3DS, email validation, automatic geolocation lookup and of course a neat transition animation.

## Cloud Administration Platform

Managing our customers was originally an admin-only view built into the app frontend. Another prime candidate for rebuilding with our design system.

From here our team of administrators can review trial requests, existing accounts and the status of each of our clusters.

## Corellium App

Outside of our greenfield projects my primary role has been to maintain the frontend of the Corellium app. We started by working in fortnightly sprints, usually prioritising bugs and the features for upcoming releases. Across hundreds of tickets I've implemented new device interaction features, administration features, enterprise features such as whitelabelling, and supported the launch of multiple Android, iPhone and IoT devices.

The codebase is quite large and complex and has some areas for improvement that we're still working hard at to make it on-par with our design system and other frontend applications. One of the first big cleanup items was converting all stylesheets to make use of design tokens and bring about greater consistency, improved accessibility and introduce a more modern UI.

Through an audit of hundreds of files I found that we were almost using 50 shades of gray. Colours were in a similar state with not particular pattern to the application.

Grays were converted into a 100's system and colours received a similar treatment moving to a 4-colour system for primary, success and error.

The team is also currently in the process of converting everything to TypeScript while also moving from classes to functional components.

I also worked with the product and data teams to implement tracking across the website, the trial request flow, and the app using GTM, GA and Segment.
